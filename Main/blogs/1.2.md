## 🏕️ Terrain-Aware Structure Overhauls

Restructured isn't just about adding content, it's about refining the world.  
Many existing structures have been **rebuilt to respond dynamically to terrain**, leading to more organic generation and smoother integration with the surrounding landscape.

## And more!
Of course there is more we haven't discussed, since we want to keep them as surprises! 

There is one feature we are really excited about, and that is letting players use `/locate structure` to locate Better on Bedrock structures!

We are working on supporting locator maps as well :D
