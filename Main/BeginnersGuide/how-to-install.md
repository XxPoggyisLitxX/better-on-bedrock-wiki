## Importing the addon

### PC

To import the Add-On to your Minecraft application, once you have downloaded the Add-On from either of the links above, head to your files folder where you will see the .mcaddon file.

As you can see below:

After doing this, the Add-On will start to import into your Minecraft application.

### Mobile

With Minecraft, installing the Add-On is a bit of a tedious task as it requires more steps on a lot of devices. This wiki can only provide so much information, as there are many different versions and brands of devices that people use.

One method of correctly installing the Add-On to your world is by following the steps below:

After installing the Add-On via MCPEDL or the Discord server, the Add-On should appear in your mobile files similar to the image below:

To make this file compatible with Minecraft, we have to do a few things. For example, we need to remove the .zip extension at the end of the file name:

Not only do we have to remove the .zip, but in many cases, you'll also have to rename the Add-On completely, as this can prevent Minecraft from giving you the option to open it. This wiki suggests either renaming the Add-On fully, such as `Bob.mcaddon`, or using the name shown in the image below:

Following all the steps above, it should now let you open the file using Minecraft and successfully import it into your Minecraft application.
