After doing this the Add-On will start to import into your minecraft application
### Mobile

With minecraft the Add-on is a bit of a tedious task as it requires more steps on alot of devices, this wiki can only provide so much information about the steps as there is all different versions of devices and different brands of devices that people use.

One method of correctly installing the Add-On to your world is by following the steps below:

After installing the Add-On via mcpedl or the discord server, the Add-On should show up as a file within your mobiles files as something similar to the image below

To make this file able to be opened with minecraft we have to do a few things for example we need to remove the .zip at the end of the file name

Not only do we have to remove the .zip but you will also in alot of cases have to rename the addon completely as this can cause the addon not to give you the option to open with minecraft. This wiki suggest you either rename the Add-On fully to the extent of being the case of `Bob.mcaddon` or you can rename to what is shown in the image below
