When coming to add Better on Bedrock to your world you need to make sure you are doing it correctly otherwise the Add-On may not function correctly

### Customizing my world

With Better on Bedrock you can customise your world however you like! including changing many gamerules within the world to your liking! Even if its you wanting to play the Add-On with tedious and small aspects such as turning fire spread off! or even enabling show coordinates! Better on Bedrock does not hinder the ability for you the player to do this whilst using the Add-On

### Resource Pack

Make sure you have the up to date Better on Bedrock Resource pack added to your world so this way it prevents any textures being lost with items and many more aspects of the functional aspects of the Add-On

### Behabiour Pack

The behaviour pack within any Add-On is the main purpose of why the Add-On actually works! Not having this within your world doesnt allow any of the Add-On to preform how its supposed to preform for you!

### Experimental Toggles

Better on Bedrock unlike any other Add-On currently being made by many other developers on Minecraft Bedrock Edition does not rely on any other experimental toggles other than the "Beta-Api" toggle. BUT ensure that Better on Bedrock will not preform to the full capabilities you wish if you decide to enable more than just the "Beta-Api" as this can cause majour texture loss to you the player!
